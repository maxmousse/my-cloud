# My cloud

This repository contains a simple but fully usable setup for a self-hosted
nextcloud instance. Feel free to fork it and adapt it to your own needs!

## Description

The setup rely on docker and docker-compose. As docker is plateform agnostic, the docker
compose file should be usable on any plateform, but please keep in mind that it is only tested
on Ubuntu server so I can not guaranty that it will work on other plateforms (especially the
bash scripts for setup).

The infrastructure is composed of the next parts:

- A Nextcloud fpm container (A server is not included in this image). You can find 
the documentation here: https://github.com/docker-library/docs/blob/master/nextcloud/README.md .

-  A postgres database that hosts the Nextcloud data. For more information, check postgres
documentation: https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres .

- A redis container is in charged of in memory cache (used by nextcloud to keep track of locked files).
Once again, refer to Nextcloud or redis documentation (https://hub.docker.com/_/redis) for more
information. 

- The Nextcloud application is served by a Nginx server. Note that this server only serves nextcloud
pages and is not in charged of SSL encryption. You can find usefull Nginx configuration example in
the Nextcloud docker configuration examples (https://github.com/nextcloud/docker/tree/master/.examples).

- The https encryption and the SSL certificate generation is handled by a Traefik reverse proxy. It is the
entrypoint of the whole infarstructure. Refer to Traefik documentation for more details: https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/

- I host my Nextcloud instance at home, behind my internet provider router. As many internet providers do not offer static
IP (mine does not) I bought my domain name to google that propose a free dynamic DNSÂ service. The ddns service you can see
in `app/docker-compose.dyndns.yml` is in charge of polling google DNS to keep my DNS up to date with my dynamic IP.
This service will probably not be needed by everyone, that is why it is in a separate docker-compose file.

## Requirements

Here are the requirements to run this Nextcloud instance at home:

- A computer with `Ubuntu server 20.04`.You can run it on a Raspberry Pi 3 but it will be pretty slow. Adapt your hardware
to your needs (I use a ODROID H2+ board).

- A domain name whith DNS access (have a look at google DNS if you do not have a static IP).

- A SMPT provider if you want your Nextcloud instance to be able to send emails (for password reset, admin notification...)
